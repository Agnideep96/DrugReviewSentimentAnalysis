# Predicting the Efficacy Rate of Different Drugsbased on Patient Reviews

Accurately predicting drug efficacy can help ensure that the most effective drugs are prescribed to patients. This can lead to improved treatment outcomes and better patient care. While clinical trials provide critical information about the effectiveness of a drug, they are often expensive, time-consuming, and may not fully capture the experience of patients using the drug in real-world settings. On the other hand, patient-reported outcomes, such as reviews and ratings, can provide valuable insights into drug efficacy and help personalize treatment. In this paper, we explore the use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract relevant information from patient reviews and ultimately predict drug efficacy. We apply the Knowledge Discovery in Database (KDD) methodology to process the data and then investigate the effectiveness of various data mining models: Random Forests, Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbours. The models’ performance is evaluated on a realworld dataset, ”UCI ML Drug Review”, obtained by crawling the pharmacology website Drugs.com. In our study we evaluated the models’ performance on two distinct tasks: categorizing the sentiment of reviews as positive or negative and classifying drug rating scores on a scale of 1-10. Our findings indicate that Random Forests outperformed the other models in both cases, achieving a high accuracy rate of more than 90% for binary classification and 75% for multi-class classification.

## Conclusion
Predicting drug efficacy based on patient reviews can be a valuable method for improving the research and development of new and existing drugs. Online patient reviews provide realworld data on drug efficacy in a variety of patient populations and settings. This information can complement data from clinical trials and help researchers understand how a drug performs in the real world. In this paper we applied data analysis to extract relevant information from patient reviews and through the use of data mining techniques we built models capable of predicting the efficacy of different drugs based on a 1-10 scale rating. We compared three different machine learning models - Random Forests, Naive Bayes and KNearest Neighbours - and their performance was evaluated on a real-world dataset: ”UCI ML Drug Review”. We tested the models on two separate problems: binary classification of the sentiment associated with each review (positive or negative) and multi-class classification of the drug rating score (on a 1-10 scale). Results showed that Random Forests performed best in both scenarios, achieving an accuracy of over 90% for binary classification and 75% for multi-class prediction.
